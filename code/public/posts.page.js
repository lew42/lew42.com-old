But, if we designed a new super-language, and taught it around the world, so that we all just have to learn 1 other language, and we're immediately a globally-linguistic species...

Then go around to popular stackoverflow posts, reddit, codrops? etc, and point them back to my website.  My page can introduce the concept, maybe with some illustrations or even a video.  And, I can have a bunch of sidebar posts tantilizing their imagination.  And they can click through to the GitHub page to check it out, obviously.");

You could create a new branch to isolate all your changes.  Personally, I'm not great with git, and fast-forwarding and rewinding at will doesn't come natural to me.");

This is where code control comes into play.  You need to be able to duplicate an arbitrarily sized portion of your app (the whole thing, or any chunk, or any tiny piece), and start hacking around with it.");
